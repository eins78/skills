# Plot Phases 2-4: Sprint Retro Improvements

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Source:** Claude Code

## Summary

Implemented items 7-15 from the plot sprint retrospective improvements report. Nine commits adding batch mode docs, externalized templates, troubleshooting, quickstart guide, automation output mode, sprint item annotations, and review tracking.

## Key Accomplishments

- Added batch mode documentation to plot-idea and plot-approve
- Externalized plan, sprint, and retrospective templates into `skills/plot/templates/`
- Added troubleshooting section to hub skill (7 recovery scenarios)
- Created quickstart guide for new adopters
- Added automation output mode with JSON schema for machine-readable output
- Added sprint item annotations (state machine) — plan-backed items carry HTML comment annotations tracking PR, status, branch
- Added review tracking with SHA comparison and `plot-review-status.sh` helper script
- Created PR #13

## Changes Made

- Created: `skills/plot/templates/plan.md`
- Created: `skills/plot/templates/sprint.md`
- Created: `skills/plot/templates/retrospective.md`
- Created: `skills/plot/docs/quickstart.md`
- Created: `skills/plot/scripts/plot-review-status.sh`
- Modified: `skills/plot/SKILL.md` (+Troubleshooting, +Automation Output)
- Modified: `skills/plot-idea/SKILL.md` (+Batch Mode, template externalized)
- Modified: `skills/plot-approve/SKILL.md` (+Batch Mode, +sprint annotation in step 7)
- Modified: `skills/plot-deliver/SKILL.md` (+sprint annotation in step 7)
- Modified: `skills/plot-sprint/SKILL.md` (template externalized, +Item Annotations, +Review Tracking, retro template ref)

## Decisions

- Hub-level automation output instruction only: deferred per-spoke reinforcement to test if hub-level is sufficient
- Review tracking uses HTML comment annotations in sprint files rather than a separate state file — keeps sprint file as single source of truth
- Retrospective template includes metrics section (must-haves, should-haves, deferred, duration) beyond the basic what-went-well structure

## Next Steps

- [ ] PR #13 review and merge
- [ ] ralph-sprint.sh integration (separate session)
- [ ] Test `plot-review-status.sh` against a sprint file with real annotations
- [ ] Per-spoke automation output hints if hub-level proves insufficient
