# Cursor Session Restoration

Placeholder for Cursor-specific session restoration. Called from [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) step 1.

## Status

Not yet implemented. Cursor stores session data differently from Claude Code and the restoration procedure needs to be documented.

## Planned Content

- Locating Cursor session/conversation files
- Extracting conversation history from Cursor's storage format
- Detecting session boundaries and compaction (if applicable)
- Mapping Cursor's session model to the wrap-up checklist
